        <h1>What is a blog post?</h1>
        <p> A blog post is an individual web page on your website that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog.
        </p>

        <p>For instance, let's say you start a fashion blog on your retail website. One blog post might be titled, "The
            Best Fall Shoes for 2019". The post ties back to your overall blog topic as a whole (fashion), but it also
            addresses a very particular sub-topic (fall shoes).
        </p>

        <p> Blog posts allow you to rank on search engines for a variety of keywords. In the above example, your blog
            post could enable your business to rank on Google for "fall shoes". When someone searches for fall shoes and
            comes across your blog post, they have access to the rest of your company's website. They might click
            "Products" after they read your post, and take a look at the clothing items your company sells.
